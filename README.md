# Human Typing Simulator

## Details
This python script is intended to simulate human typing on Microsoft Word, with the capability of bypassing Microsoft Word's "Browsing Version History".

I DO NOT INDORSE the usage of this script as a means of cloaking suspicion when submitting assigments that are copy and pasted with paraphrased/AI created work, which is TOTALLY not its original intention
(please don't expell me i swear i'm trolling)

## Installation and Usage

Will add soon lmao
